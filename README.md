## Getting Started

 To ensure the application functions correctly, you need to set up and install the API from the repository [web-scraping-api-ts](https://github.com/VictorDavydenko008/web-scraping-api-ts). This API handles the data scraping and provides the necessary endpoints for this app to retrieve product information.

### Installation

1. Clone the [web-scraping-api-ts](https://github.com/VictorDavydenko008/web-scraping-api-ts) repository and follow the instructions in the README to install and run the API.

2. Once the API is up and running, clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VictorDavydenko008/react-products-visualization-app.git
   cd react-products-visualization-app

2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Create a `.env` file based on the provided `.env-example`:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Building
